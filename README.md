#ESP32 SSD1306 Driver

A general software driver for the SSD1306 OLED driver chip for the ESP-IDF toolchain.

This repo is a fork of [imxieyi/esp32-i2c-ssd1306-oled](https://github.com/imxieyi/esp32-i2c-ssd1306-oled), modified to be more generalized and to incopororate a SPI protocol driver along with I2C

The communication protocol drivers use the ESP-IDF APIs for I2C and SPI.
